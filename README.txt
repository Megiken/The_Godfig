hACK ER MAN
anyways
so first of all you can chose either m0rehud or vanilla improved tf2 hud or``` you can be cool like Seattle 1 and use weirdcore hud, seriously this thing is fucking amazing
its visually distinct familiar while not sacrificing much of any visual clarity. its got a breath of fresh air style that still remains core to tf2 and by extension
2010s to present internet culture as a whole. and its just really fuckng pretty too
m0re hud is the most customizable feature rich easy to use tf2 project ever period end of story
what a fucking marvel
hud editing SUCKS
check my other gits
it FUCKNG SUCKS
so for us to have a hud with every available feature fully customizable from a neatly designed comfortable clear ui IN FUCKING GAME is absolutely fukcing bonkers
idk who exactly is responsible for what with most tf2 projects as i spend all my community time in game, but seriously shoutouts to more hud man
and of course the exact same is also true for master comfig which makes all that other time so fucking easy and quick and painless that i love both of these projects
more than my 20000000000000 unborn children. and i also hand picked a hitmarker and crosshair from the cream of the crop (most likes on game banana) in stylized faithful hd tf2 hitmarkers and crosshairs as well if you go
the weirdcorehud(true) route. dont be a genocider and use m0re hud option... respectfully
BREAK IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!LLL===lll=lLLLL:::
lol there is no option dipshit google that bitch
anywhos
m0re hud is definitely where id get my feet wet if you're new to all this fancy mumbo jumbo, but i guarantee you weirdc0re hud is better than all that shit anyways
the hitsound is super fucking poggers good idea to the guy who combined those its the MW2 + TF2 hitsound and killsound pack on game banana
oh right my stuff again
ok
uhhh
fuck
so
basically
every single tf2 input is mapped to what i consider optimal perfection (as close as you can get without quantum fingers at least)
wasd
they move you
ok but what else can they do
so
if you type
say_team "I'm moving forward" in the console it will show
F2P GIBUS PYYRO(;)) (TEAM): I'm moving forward
wow
incredible
especially if (TEAM) is in the right place and not at the start like I'm worried it might be
no fucking shit
anyways
did you know i have a different name?
It's a name unknown to all
that ive gon by since the dawn of all time
ok maybe not that far back
but at least to when i first installed steam and tf2
its myy.... secret name
as such i will not be revealing the details of the chars contained within the string to you mere mortals
however
you can call it something special
my alias
what the fuck is an alias i hear you mutter if you're as bad as I think you are based off our friendly and sportsman like ingame interactions, aliased online battle bretheren!!!
lol
so yeah\
you can combine commands with them
no where in the game does it tell you about this
you have to go... undercover
https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting
yeah i know
not for the faint of heart
anywhos
yeah so i did that on a bunch of keys
pretty much all of the important ones in fact
if youre playing heavy and press W
all 3 gold hat wearing shine australium bearded flaming burning team dipshit butbuddy femboy mafemale and any other fucking uninhibitating fucking world sex view that they have cause who the fuck cares all we're here to do is read based readmes and click see numbers and hear dingalings
and complain about pyros
anywhos
SPECIAL FEATURE INSERT:
    Movement keys (no voicelines only movement on engy medic sniper and spy, if you wanna be a cool edgelord scout who never reveals his secrets then i guess you could argue       disabling them on scout and maybe pyro is optimal, but fuck that we ball)
    W: Moveforward + say medic (you're not retreating)
    S: Movebackward + say gogogo (you're retreating)
    A and D go left and right and move left and right (respectively)
    E: Call for help with flavor, why do you need help dumbass
    Probably cause thing is going to be happening soon
    you could almost say that something
    is incoming
    yeah
    q calls for help cause you need ammo so it also AMMO!!! in team chat so you have good evidence when you see that pink fast learner tossle cap scout in court next year
    123 are voicemenu now trust me except on spy and engy dont trust me there yet
    zxc are primary secondary and tertiary (melee i think thats the right word, i meant tertiary not melee if you were wondering)
    IMPORTANT SPOTLIGHT MOMENT
    ive been terorizing the entirety of uncletopia seattle 1 (MASSIVE!!!) with zxc on spy because they also swap your weapon
    speaking of which
    shift and right click are various things on all classes but their tweaked so that if your class needs to be able to move while doing something you will never have to take your fingers off wasd BECAUSE
scroll wheel up is primary
melee is on mouse 4
and x is shift or mouse 2 on classes that need it there, x on everyone else idr rn who does what but its all perfect i promise
for example
on soldier shift swaps to shotgun
rightclick performs jump crouch shoot at the same time
on demo too!
except he shoots 2
the second shot
the right click
any ways all those little niche things that you wouldnt normally care too much or think about are included
but every decision across every key is optimized with ergonomics (speaking of which my wrists are starting to hurt lol i love my mx clears
_)

    
  


you press w with this config and i guarantee you every hot asian 5ft2 kawaiicorepilled heterosexual virgin medic gfwb will be shoving their medigun/kritz/quickfix/"vacc"inator an
d shoutouts to the crossbow -
so far up your poo hole that even the 2 girls one cup talent wouldnt want to get a single morcel of overheal from any of them.
im the fucking man
anyways
yeah
just try it
i put shift or mouse 2 as some optimal combination of jump shoot crouth shoot2 shoot3 shoot4 shoot sapper shootspy shoot disguise shoot scout heavyweapons voicemenu voice_menu voice menu lines
i put a lot of fucking time into this... any support is greatly appreciated
below is an informal detailed list from the top of my dome and the tips of my fingers (which are not yet quantum unfortunately) spacexsharex collab when?
voicelines for movement keys are only utilized on power classes... an informant is informing that means that spy sniper medic and engineer don't do that
mouse 1 is nice shot on every class except scout cause of course it is
oh right the mouse
ive been neglecting that for quite some time
